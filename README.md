# SaneTube
An extension that helps you watch YouTube while maintaining your sanity (success not guaranteed)

This extremely simple extension will automatically redirect you to your YouTube subscriptions page whenever you try to view the YouTube homepage, or you try watching YouTube shorts. You can still watch regular YouTube videos as well as search for videos, but this extension will block the most soul-sucking parts of the website

# Development
